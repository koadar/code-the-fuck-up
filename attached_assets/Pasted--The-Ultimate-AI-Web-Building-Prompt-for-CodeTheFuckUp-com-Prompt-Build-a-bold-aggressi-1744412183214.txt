

The Ultimate AI Web-Building Prompt for CodeTheFuckUp.com

> Prompt:

Build a bold, aggressive, unapologetically real website called CodeTheFuckUp.com — a no-bullshit platform for software developers tired of fake tech influencer culture, over-polished tutorials, and corporate vanilla blog posts.

Tone and Brand Identity:

Ruthless honesty

Dark humor

Rant energy

Anti-influencer, anti-cringe, anti-buzzword

Street-smart meets tech-smart


Think of it as a punk-rock dev blog meets underground tech cult — edgy, hilarious, brutally honest, and deeply relatable to real devs in the trenches.

Design Requirements:

Dark theme with gritty, sharp edges

Use bold typography, all-caps for titles

Animated console-style typing effect in headers

“Error-glitch” effects on hover for buttons

Terminal-style quotes and comment callouts

Trash bin icon that deletes entire blog post drafts

“Fuck It Mode” – toggles a chaotic, no-filter version of the site with NSFW rants and real-life dev disasters


Core Sections:

1. Hot Rants – Raw blog posts about the real dev life


2. Tech Lies We Swallowed – Bust myths, influencer lies, and fake job titles


3. Cringe Gallery – Screenshots of awful LinkedIn flexes and resume disasters


4. Real Devs, Real Shit – User-submitted stories of failure, burnout, and breakthroughs


5. Build. Burn. Rebuild. – Coding stories that went wrong but taught lessons


6. Anti-Guru Guide – Parody of influencer-style courses with “zero value” promises



Blog Titles to Seed the Site With:

“The Tech Influencer Lied and I Believed It”

“Code Like You're Dead Inside”

“Microservices Made Me Hate Life”

“Fuck Your Coding Bootcamp Success Story”

“They Said It Was Agile, We Got Whiplash”

“Why Every Dev Should Break Production At Least Once”

“Centering a Div Gave Me PTSD”

“I Put ‘Blockchain’ on My Resume and Got Hired”

“Tutorial Hell: The Netflix of Productivity”

“Git Blame is My Therapist”

“No One Cares About Your 100 Days of Code Thread”


Crazy Features to Include:

Rage Comment Mode: Add profanity-laced reactions (toggle safe mode for SFW users)

Real Resume Builder: Builds a CV that’s 80% sarcasm, 20% truth, 100% relatable

LinkedIn Filter: A widget that auto-generates sarcastic reactions to buzzword-heavy posts

“Deploy or Die” Button: A random motivational/dev-spiral quote each time it's clicked

Daily Fuck-Up Generator: Confessions from devs about their biggest mistakes

“Code Confession Booth”: Anonymously submit dev sins (e.g., pushed to prod without tests)

404 Page: Looks like a crashed IDE. “You broke it. Good job.”

Rant-to-Blog Converter: Paste your chat log/rant, and the site formats it into an aggressive blog post

Goals of the Site:

Call out the fakeness in tech culture
